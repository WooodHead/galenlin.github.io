[Small][small] was published to github on December 30, 2015. 

At first, I wish to collect 1,000 stars in a month, but now I found it was really tough and I only get 8,06 stars currently. Though it did not meet my expectations, I was pleased with it because it was my first product on github.

During this period, I'm learning how to work on github and how to spread my project out.

Following is my operating diary in this month, and now I wanna to share it for you.
